## About

AMUN is a mod for Minecraft providing common functionality for other mods (specifically mods by SophosMZ, or its developers, but of course it can be used by anyone).

## Goals

* Making modding at any level **easier**
* Making development **fast**
* Making mod code **elegant**
* Making a library that can be modified and used by **anyone**
* Bringing more **modern** approaches to software design to Minecraft

It's main goal is making development as fast and easy as possible but still flexible.

The key word in the previous paragraph is "*flexible*", every part of AMUN is configurable, from configuration formats to compatibility modules.

One other way AMUN wants to make itself configurable in the future is a scripting interface for adding functionality to it as a end user, or in "functionality packs".

## Installation

Just put this mod into the "minecraft/mods" folder, all dependent assets will be downloaded when you first launch the game.
