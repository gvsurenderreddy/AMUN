## Issues and Suggestions

1. Bug reports

  - When committing bug reports (and want us to help you) we need a bit information about the bug, simply sending `It doesn't work fix it!!1!!` doesn't help. We won't outright reject them but we will ask you to read this and add more information to the report.<br>
  To make it easer for you to make a good report I have made a checklist for what to do:

    1. Use common sense, is AMUN really causing the issue.
    2. Make sure you are using a supported version (when a version gets old we will stop to support it), and that you are using the newest non-beta version for the version you are playing.
    3. See if the bug you are experiencing hasn't already been answered or fixed.
    4. Go to the [issue page](https://github.com/SophosMZ/AMUN/issues) and click on [new issue](https://github.com/SophosMZ/AMUN/issues/new).
      1. Don't add any tags to it, we'll take care of that.
      2. Give your issue a sensible title (`It doesn't work` or `Found a bug` doesn't count). The title should summarize the issue (`AMUN crashes on launch`).
      3. Include the necessary details:
          - Minecraft version
          - Mod version
          - Forge version
          - The crash log, but don't just paste it in the report, instead upload it to a site like [pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com) or [pastee.org](https://pastee.org) and link it in the report.<br>
          This log is located at "minecraft/crash-reports/crash-DATE_TIME-client/server.txt"
          - The full log, for this the same rules apply. It is located at "minecraft/logs/fml-client-latest.log" (This isn't really necessary but sometimes we'll ask for it).
          - When you are reporting an issue between AMUN and another mod (or what you suspect to be) also include the mod list.
          - A detailed description of the bug.
          - A detailed explanation on how to reproduce the bug.
      4. Some other detailed are nice to have but not necessary, please try to include the following if applicable
          - What did you expect to happen
          - Did it happen on a server or in single player
          - Screenshots of the problem
          - The modpack you are using and the version of it
            - You should also file a report to the pack author

    5. Click Submit `New Issue` and wait for feedback!

2. Suggestions

  - Suggestions can be anything from new features to a new code format (the latter will be rejected in most cases, but it is still valid).<br>
  When filing such an "issue" you should also consider some things:
    1. Is this feature already implemented
    2. Is this reasonably possible to do with just vanilla Minecraft and this mod (making a redstone computer instead on a modded one isn't reasonable).
    3. Is it a major feature of a major mod.
  - If none of the above applies, you are good to go:
    1. Go to the [issue page](https://github.com/SophosMZ/AMUN/issues) and click on [new issue](https://github.com/SophosMZ/AMUN/issues/new).
      1. Don't add any tags to it, we'll take care of that.
      2. Give it a descriptive title (`new feature` or `NEW FEATURE MUST BE IMPLEMENTED!!1!!` doesn't count).
      3. Include all details that are needed, there isn't a "too long".
